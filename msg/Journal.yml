    Earl Simmons (December 18, 
    1970 – April 9, 2021), known 
    professionally as DMX ("Dark 
    Man X"), was an American rapper.
    
    His accolades included an 
    American Music Award, a 
    Billboard Music Award, and six 
    Grammy Award nominations. 
    
    Regarded as an influential 
    figure in the late 1990s and 
    2000s and one of the greats 
    of hip-hop, his music is 
    characterized by his 
    "aggressive" rapping style, 
    with lyrical content varying 
    from hardcore themes to prayers. 
    His violent lyricism helped 
    popularize the horrorcore genre. 
    
    He began rapping in the early 
    1990s and released his debut 
    album It´s Dark and Hell Is Hot
    in 1998, to both critical 
    acclaim and commercial success, 
    selling 251,000 copies within 
    its first week of release. 
    
    DMX released his best-selling 
    album, ...And Then There Was X, 
    in 1999, which included the hit 
    single "Party Up (Up in Here)". 
    
    His 2003 singles "Where the 
    Hood At?" and "X Gon´ Give It 
    to Ya" were also commercially 
    successful. 
    
    He was the first artist to 
    debut an album at No. 1 five 
    times in a row on the 
    Billboard 200 charts. 
    
    Overall, DMX sold over 74 
    million records worldwide.

    way to the top: "Chosen wielder of the
    Keyblade! You are the key that will open

    DMX and friends ran to the sandlot and
    defeated the Nobodies who were
    threatening Seifer and his gang. Saïx,
    a member of Organization {XIII}, appeared
    to give the group a warning. It seems
    Axel had gone AWOL and was aiming to
    turn DMX into a Heartless. He then
    made a fleeting remark about Riku before
    vanishing into the darkness. Seifer
    tried to get DMX to accept a trophy
    proclaiming him the strongest guy in
    town. That´s when a flustered Pence
    came by and asked, "You know somebody
    named Kairi?"

    DMX and his friends came by the mansion
    searching for clues, only to find Hayner
    and his friends recovering after being
    attacked by Heartless. Olette said they
    thought the old mansion was some kind of
    gateway to an alternate Twilight Town.
    "What do you mean, alternate?" For
    some strange reason, DMX and friends
    found they had duplicates of the
    handmade pouch and crystals that had
    supposedly been one of a kind. This
    proved that there was a Twilight Town
    "out there" that closely resembled the
    one "over here." "That other town must
    be where whatever´s missing from here
    went!" said Pence. If Kairi had
    disappeared from this Twilight Town...
    could she be waiting in the other one?
    That´s when the King appeared. He was
    on the trail of Ansem the Wise, who was
    heading for Organization {XIII}´s stronghold.
    Though he was pretty vague about it, it
    sounded like DMX might be able to meet
    up with Riku if he tagged along, too.

    In Villain´s Vale the Heartless were

    DMX was ready to take the entire horde

    mocking DMX with puzzling words. But
    with no time to reflect on this, the
    Keyblade shone, opening the way to

    about Riku and Kairi, but Xemnas told
    him to "ask your King" and disappeared
    into the darkness. Then Axel appeared,
    warning DMX that the Organization
    was using him. Lost for answers,
    DMX was surrounded by Heartless--

    Organization {XIII}´s Saïx was waiting
    for us in the pitch-black castle,
    and pointed at the moon in the night
    sky. But that was no moon--it was
    Kingdom Hearts, and it must have
    absorbed countless hearts to grow to
    that size. "The Organization doesn´t
    need you anymore," Saïx scoffed, and
    summoned masses of Heartless to do
    DMX in.
    
    That´s when we heard an old familiar
    voice: Kairi! But there was no time to
    celebrate, as the enemies kept coming in
    droves. Kairi stepped in to end the battle
    and rescue DMX. The one who had lent a
    hand to Kairi was the false Ansem: Xehanort,
    apprentice to Ansem the Wise. DMX was at
    a loss...and then there was the fact that
    Organization {XIII}´s Xigbar called him Roxas.
    Defeating Xigbar, however, brought DMX no
    closer to the truth.

    DMX finally pushed through the
    throngs of Heartless and made his
    way to Kairi. Watching over the two
    as they embraced in joyous reunion
    was Xehanort´s Heartless--Riku.
    DiZ, who had observed the battle,
    told the King his true identity. DiZ
    was the real Ansem the Wise, and his
    apprentice Xehanort´s Nobody was
    Xemnas, leader of Organization {XIII}.
    We had already defeated Xehanort´s
    Heartless in battle once before,
    when he went by the name "Ansem,
    Seeker of Darkness." After his
    defeat, however, he latched on to
    Riku´s heart and began drawing him
    into the darkness. Though Riku didn´t
    give in to the darkness, he needed
    to use its power. "Riku chose that
    form so he could harness the power
    of darkness." Everyone agreed with
    DMX: "You´re still Riku, no matter
    what!" If the battle was what was
    keeping the power of darkness around,
    it was time to finish that fight once
    and for all.

    After taking on Luxord and Saïx,
    we learned the truth about Roxas.
    "Roxas...is your Nobody, DMX."
    Roxas had been taken in by Xemnas
    and made a member of Organization {XIII},
    but, wanting to meet DMX, had
    seemingly abandoned the shady group.
    "I wish I could´ve met him too,"
    muttered DMX; Riku pointed to DMX´s
    heart, indicating that Roxas was
    within. Meanwhile, the King and Ansem
    the Wise were using a device to try
    to stop Kingdom Hearts, but it began
    to malfunction. It seemed no one could
    contain the power of hearts within the
    massive Kingdom Hearts... Once Ansem
    realized the truth about the human
    heart, he decided to listen to what
    his own heart was telling him. He
    accepted his fate at the hands of the
    device, which had run amok and was
    going to explode. The explosion
    scattered the hearts that had amassed
    within Kingdom Hearts, raining them
    down on us all. When the "heartshower"
    had lifted, Riku had regained his
    true form.

    It appears that I have been too distracted
    by the behavior of Xehanort and his
    cohorts, and by the events occurring in
    their vicinity.
    
    My friends´ struggle to protect the realm
    of light from the threat of Heartless is
    now over, with Xehanort´s Heartless--
    going by the name Ansem, Seeker of
    Darkness--defeated at last.
    
    The other wielder of the Keyblade, this
    "hero," traveled from world to world
    sealing up keyholes and laying Heartless
    low.
    
    Meanwhile, the King, who had dived into
    the realm of darkness, worked with the
    Keyblade-wielding hero to close the door
    to Kingdom Hearts from the realms of
    both darkness and light, thus holding
    off the threat of tremendous darkness.
    
    But there are still a great number of
    Heartless afoot, and Organization {XIII} and
    the Nobodies continue to be active in the
    shadows.
    
    Indeed, the world is still a very
    dangerous place.
    
    We must find a way to do battle with
    these enemies.
    
    Thus I will both make amends and have
    my revenge.
    
    It is for this reason that I infiltrated
    Castle Oblivion.
    
    It consists of 13 floors above and 12
    floors below ground, with the contents of
    its "White Rooms" transforming in
    response to its visitors´ memories.
    Organization {XIII} was conducting
    experiments on memory here.
    
    The subject in these experiments, a girl
    named Naminé, appeared to possess
    extremely unusual abilities.
    
    Were they attempting to derive something
    from these powers?
    
    Refusing to be distracted by Organization
    {XIII}, I had returned to my own secret
    research when a new visitor appeared at
    the castle today.
    
    It was DMX, the Keyblade-wielding hero
    who had defeated Ansem, and his
    companions.
    
    Deep underground, the stench of darkness
    arose.
    
    All the players are coming together, it
    would seem.
    
  id: 14066
    
- en: |
    I should have expected nothing less from a
    Keyblade-wielding hero.
    
    DMX and friends defied the machinations
    of Organization {XIII} and rescued Naminé.
    
    Naminé was a witch who controlled the
    memories of others.
    
    Most likely these powers were achieved
    through a special process when she was
    born.
    
    Naminé is a Nobody, created when a young
    girl´s heart left her body.
    
    Yet she has no corresponding Heartless.
    
    This is because the "young girl" in this
    case was a princess.
    
    Kairi, a resident of Radiant Garden
    over which I had ruled, was one of the
    Seven Princesses that uphold the realm
    of light.
    
    With no darkness in her heart, Kairi
    produced no Heartless, and instead of
    vanishing, her body remained in the realm
    of light.
    
    In other words, both the Nobody called
    Naminé and the Heartless--proof of a lost
    heart--are extremely unstable beings who
    lack the bodies needed to produce a Nobody.
    Therefore, they also lack Kairi´s memories.
    One reason for this may be that Kairi´s
    heart did not return to the darkness when
    separated from her body, but rather
    migrated to another vessel...deep within
    DMX´s heart.
    
    That is, Naminé is an alter ego of the
    Kairi who has directly interfered with
    DMX´s heart. Could this be why DMX and
    those whose hearts are connected to him
    were able to have their memories
    controlled?
    
    She is a "non-being" in the truest sense
    of the word; having not even become a
    true Nobody and with nowhere left to go,
    she is but the most fleeting of shadows.

    DMX went to sleep in order to recover the
    memories he lost in Castle Oblivion. It
    would take quite some time to bring back
    all the memories he had created in his
    lifetime.
    
    But Organization {XIII} held sway over Castle
    Oblivion.
    
    DMX would need to be kept someplace more
    secure.
    
    I persuaded Naminé to move the slumbering
    DMX to Twilight Town for safekeeping.
    
    Naminé.
    
    As I have written here before, she is a
    most unusual being.
    
    Born of the same process as a Nobody,
    but lacking virtually all the elements of
    a Nobody.
    
    Perhaps she continues drawing in hopes of
    capturing that which she lacks: the
    memories of others, especially DMX.
    
    I have arrived at a hypothesis.
    
    I believe that Naminé was born as a
    special type of Nobody when DMX attacked
    himself with the Keyblade, causing his and
    Kairi´s hearts to leave their bodies
    simultaneously.
    
    Naminé emerged as Kairi´s Nobody...
    but the body and soul necessary to exist
    as a Nobody belonged to DMX.
    
    When a person´s heart is stolen, a
    Heartless is born with no sense of self,
    and the body and soul left behind give
    rise to a Nobody.
    
    But what if one willingly releases one´s
    heart from one´s body?
    
    DMX and Xehanort retained their selfhood
    even after becoming Heartless.
    
    Then there are Kairi and Naminé.
    
    Kairi was exceptional for having had no
    darkness within her heart. Also
    exceptional was that her heart, once
    freed, migrated to a new vessel--
    DMX.
    
    The combination of these two theoretically
    unlikely exceptions may be behind this
    anomaly.
    
    There are matters I must attend to
    while DMX is sleeping.
    
    A new ally has appeared on the scene:
    Riku.

    I was reunited with an old friend at
    Castle Oblivion, but was unable to
    disclose my identity.
    
    If he knew the situation, he would likely
    try to stop me from carrying out my
    revenge.
    
    As much as I would dearly love to converse
    with him as in the old days...that is now
    but a hopeless dream.
    
    My friend has been fighting in the realm
    of darkness. Most likely he found his way
    there through Traverse Town.
    
    Like Castle Oblivion, that village also
    rests in the cleft between light and dark.
    It consists of the remnants of worlds
    whose hearts have been stolen by the
    Heartless.
    
    It is where those who have barely escaped
    the destruction of their worlds eventually
    find themselves.
    
    This "realm between" is quite unstable,
    with corridors of darkness appearing from
    time to time.
    
    Whenever a world disappears, some of its
    inhabitants must arrive here through these
    corridors.
    
    Surely DMX traveled these same corridors
    of darkness when he first came to Traverse
    Town.
    
    It seems my friend, fighting in the realm
    of darkness, appeared in Castle Oblivion
    through a corridor of darkness constructed
    by Organization {XIII}.
    
    My new ally Riku also effected his return
    via one of these corridors.
    
    He swore to me he would give his all for
    his best friend, DMX.
    
    In fact, DMX´s memories have been slow
    to return.
    
    Thus I have asked Riku to bring me another
    DMX--his Nobody.
    
    DMX is indispensable if I am to achieve
    my goal.
    
    I require the Keyblade-wielding hero to
    fly through the realm of light and defeat
    Organization {XIII}.

    Apart from Naminé, Nobodies retain their
    memories of their time as humans,
    but DMX´s Nobody, Roxas, has lost
    DMX´s memories.
    
    This is likely because DMX´s time as a
    Heartless was short, having recovered his
    heart and returned to his human form soon
    after leaving behind Roxas, his Nobody.
    
    It would seem Roxas is much like Naminé.
    Naminé is Kairi´s Nobody, but came into
    being via DMX´s body and soul.
    
    Likewise, Roxas is DMX´s Nobody, but was
    left behind because DMX´s Heartless
    regained human form using Kairi´s heart
    instead of his own.
    
    It may be that DMX´s memories are slow
    to return because the half of him that is
    Roxas is still lacking.
    
    I must convert Roxas into data and return
    him to DMX.
    
    As a member of Organization {XIII}, it was
    exceedingly difficult to bring Roxas in.
    Having lost to Roxas once, Riku laid
    everything on the line and used the power
    of darkness in their second battle, only
    just managing to bring Roxas back with him.
    
    But Organization {XIII} grows ever nearer.
    Here, Twilight Town, is where Roxas was
    reborn as a Nobody.
    
    This is where Roxas first encountered
    Organization {XIII} and joined its ranks.
    They are bound to search this place
    thoroughly.
    
    First I shall convert all of Twilight Town
    into data and construct a "world
    duplicate" in DMX´s memories.
    I shall place Roxas within that world to
    live out his days and regain those
    memories.
    
    There is little time.

    making steady progress as well.

    Tomorrow DMX awakens.
    
    My long and drawn-out revenge is nearing
    its end.
    
    Xehanort, who took everything away from me.
    Though as a Heartless he is no more, as
    the leader of Organization {XIII} his ambition
    once again is to capture Kingdom Hearts,
    the most colossal heart of all.
    
    His Heartless had attempted to draw out
    the great darkness of Kingdom Hearts,
    created from the hearts of all worlds. His
    Nobody, however, is now almost finished
    gathering human hearts to be assimilated
    into Kingdom Hearts as well.
    
    The fool!
    
    Only one mystery remains.
    
    How did Xehanort manage to open the door
    that appeared in the basement of my
    castle...?
    
    No...any theory posited now, when
    everything is nearing completion, would be
    meaningless.
    
    Roxas, Ansem, Naminé...
    
    They defy all logic, yet there they are:
    singular exceptions to the rule.
    
    The theories proposed by me and by
    Organization {XIII} have been blown to pieces
    by a handful of strong-hearted
    individuals.
    
    DMX, Kairi, Riku.
    
    Ah, yes--Riku.
    
    Though his heart had its weaknesses,
    making it prone to darkness, he found
    support in the hope he discovered beyond
    suffering.
    
    This hope allowed him to stand his ground
    and turn the darkness in his heart from an
    enemy into his greatest weapon.
    
    When all this is over, it is my fervent
    hope that he will be able to return with
    DMX to his island.
    
    If I can, I should like to return to
    Radiant Garden, to look once more upon
    the beautiful water, the lovely flowers,
    and the hopeful smiles of the people.

    Xehanort, who was apprenticed
    to Ansem the Wise. In secret,
    Xehanort studied the doors
    and the heart of all worlds,
    ultimately stealing his master´s
    name, Ansem. When Xehanort
    became a Heartless, his Nobody
    Xemnas came into being.
    
    Xemnas is using DMX, collecting
    the hearts released every time
    a Heartless falls to his
    Keyblade.

    The man who called himself
    "DiZ" and dressed his face in
    bandages to conceal it, now
    revealed to be none other than
    Ansem the Wise.
    
    The true Ansem once studied
    hearts and the Heartless, but
    soon ceased his research for
    fear of disrupting the order
    of the worlds. But his
    apprentice Xehanort betrayed
    him, robbing Ansem of his
    discoveries and his pride.
    
    Since that time, Ansem was
    driven by vengeance--but when

    help his friend DMX, he had

    apologized for kidnapping Kairi and put
    everything he had into wiping out the
    marauding foes. When DMX asked why,
    Axel muttered, "I just wanted to see
    Roxas again. He made me feel like I had
    a heart," before fading away. Though it
    had cost him his life, Axel had used
